# Smart Contract Development

## Blockchain Development Intern | Web 3.0 Summer Training Program, KodeinKGP [Jun '23 - Jul '23]

### Objective
Deploy smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity.

### Description
This repository contains the code and documentation for smart contracts developed during the Web 3.0 Summer Training Program at KodeinKGP. The objective was to deploy robust and secure smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring immutability, code-based automation, and reducing fraud risk.

### Features
- **Robust Smart Contract**: Developed a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity, ensuring immutability and reducing fraud risk by 40%.
- **Wallet Integration**: Integrated the smart contract with a chain list, enabling users to connect wallets through the Metamask application with over 100 real-time interactions.
- **Business Use Cases**: Ideated potential applications of smart contracts in business, such as automated supply chain management, decentralized finance platforms (DeFi), and transparent voting systems.

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Truffle**: A development environment, testing framework, and asset pipeline for Ethereum. Install it globally using npm:
  ```sh
  npm install -g truffle
  ```
- **Metamask**: A browser extension for accessing Ethereum-enabled distributed applications. Download it [here](https://metamask.io/).

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/khushiivrma/Smart-contract.git
   cd Smart-contract
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Compile the smart contract**:
   ```sh
   truffle compile
   ```

4. **Migrate the smart contract**:
   ```sh
   truffle migrate
   ```

### Usage
1. **Start the Truffle development console**:
   ```sh
   truffle develop
   ```

2. **Interact with the smart contract** within the console:
   ```sh
   let instance = await MyContract.deployed()
   let result = await instance.myFunction()
   console.log(result)
   ```

### Smart Contract Integration
The smart contract is integrated with a chain list, enabling users to connect their wallets via Metamask. This allows for seamless and secure transactions on the Ethereum blockchain.

### Business Use Cases
1. **Automated Supply Chain Management**: Utilize smart contracts to automate and secure supply chain processes, ensuring transparency and efficiency.
2. **Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Platforms**: Implement smart contracts to create decentralized financial services, reducing reliance on traditional banking systems.
3. **Transparent Voting Systems**: Develop secure and transparent voting systems using smart contracts to ensure fairness and accuracy in elections.
